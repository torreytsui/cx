Cloud 66 Toolbelt - CX
==

The Cloud 66 toobelt is a command line tool to interact with Cloud 66, and is available for Linux, Mac and Windows. To get started, simply [download the toolbelt executable](https://app.cloud66.com/toolbelt), unzip and copy it to a directory accessible in your PATH.

Instead of downloading the executable, you also have the option of [building it from source](https://github.com/cloud66/cx/wiki/Building-Cloud-66-toolbelt-(cx)-from-source). You can also add [auto-completing functionality](https://github.com/cloud66/cx/wiki/Setting-up-Auto-complete-for-the-toolbelt) to make your toolbelt use even easier.

Refer to our [documentation](http://help.cloud66.com/cloud-66-toolbelt/introduction.html) for more information about how you can use the toolbelt.
